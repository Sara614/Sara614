- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sara614! I'm really new to coding. I'm even more new to GitHub, so I'm still figuring this place out.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as I can, with the hopes of changing careers. Front end? Back end? I'm not sure what I want to focus on yet, so I'm just jumping into languages in which I already had a tiny bit of knowledge.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp; I'm going to start getting into Javascript shortly!
